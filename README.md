How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I can interpret what a user needs by listening to the team members I wam working with carefully. Once someone tells us what it is that they want, I can then move on to making that happen, when developing the code I would need to ensure that the code functions how it should, user stories are an important part of the process because it allows us to know details about what is important.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I will approach the development process with an open mind and try to connect to each program on a personal level. I hope to incorpoorate all of the agile processes in the future, they are the key to success in my opinion, if the process is good enough for Amazon, it is good enough for me, I look forward to working with a team of people who have each other's backs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member, to me at least, means giving it your all, trying to provide as much help as possible or the team and ensurinf successful projects. The end user being happy is always and should always be the goal. When working with a team, everyone needs to pull their own weight, but going above and beyond should be expected without it being said.
