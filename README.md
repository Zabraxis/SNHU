How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I can interpret what a user needs by listening to the team members I wam working with carefully. Once someone tells us what it is that they want, I can then move on to making that happen, when developing the code I would need to ensure that the code functions how it should, user stories are an important part of the process because it allows us to know details about what is important.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I will approach the development process with an open mind and try to connect to each program on a personal level. I hope to incorpoorate all of the agile processes in the future, they are the key to success in my opinion, if the process is good enough for Amazon, it is good enough for me, I look forward to working with a team of people who have each other's backs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member, to me at least, means giving it your all, trying to provide as much help as possible or the team and ensurinf successful projects. The end user being happy is always and should always be the goal. When working with a team, everyone needs to pull their own weight, but going above and beyond should be expected without it being said.

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Roomn wanted me to design a game that could be expanded onto different platforms

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I never feel like I have done enough for the end user, their happiness is always the goal. I have been fairly good at writing for as far as I can remember, but this being new to me has been difficult. I have learned a lot but without real world experience, I cannot say how well I have done.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I tend to re-read everything multiple times to ensure that I have done all that I can do, that is helpful to me because it ensures that I have fully understood what is being asked of me. Watching tutorial videos and a lot of browsing has been helpful to me. Learning from professionals in the field is usually very helpful.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could choose one part, I couldn't say, I would like to improve upon everything, I am a perfectionisy and there is never enough time to make it perfect. Changing one is not enough for me, I would want to change everything. Improving could be refactoring the code used, changing the design, using a different OS, there are many ways to improve and change what I have done.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I can incorporate the user's needs and implement them into the sodtware design by communicating clearly with the people asking me to design for them and listening to what they want. It is of the utmost importance to listen to what user wants, they will be the one using the software, and they should have a functional program in the end that they are happy with that functions how they want it to. Developing software is easier if you know what the end result should look like, keeping that in mind is an important part of the process.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software by reading...alot, and then reading some more, I like to learn as much as possible when starting something new. I will continue to learn and grow in the future, reading books and using online resources, nothing compares to real world experience but it is all helpful nonetheless.
